copytables
==========

![Hey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gebrkn/copytables/master/src/ico128.png)

Chrome extension to select and copy table cells.

[Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copytables/ekdpkppgmlalfkphpibadldikjimijon)

* Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> and click to select cells.
* <kbd>Alt</kbd> + double click selects a column.
* <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + double click selects a row.
* Copy selection (or the whole table) as rich text (for Word)
* Copy as HTML (for your website).
* Copy as CSV.
* Copy as tab-delimited text.

###New in version 0.2

* CSV export.
* Better HTML export.
* Better support for weird table backgrounds (thanks [apptaro](https://github.com/apptaro)).
* Overall speed improvement.
